        <h2>Values</h2>
        <h4>8/23/15</h4>
        <p>Here is a short list of things I value greatly:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Accomplishment</li>
            <li>Personal development</li>
            <li>Friendships</li>
            <li>Trust</li>
          </ul>
        <p>I am always striving to improve these areas of my life because I know it will result in a more fulfilling lifestyle. Enrolling in DBC has contributed to all four of my values. Personal development is a value that is near and dear to me. I believe I have a growth mindset but it wasn't always this way. Before I embarked on my college career, I sort of let things come my way and "went with the flow". This lack of direction left me feeling unsatisfied with myself and I knew something had to change. When I turned 19 I began to read more, self educate, and do things outside of my comfort zone. Initially it was hard to change old habits but this transition made me happier and helped me focus on my goals. I believe I can always improve myself in some way - this helps me stay optimistic and motivated to strive for more.</p>
        <p>I honestly don't feel like stereotpe threat has much of an effect on me. The only thing that holds me back from time to time is imposter syndrome. I've developed my coding skills and proved that I deserve to attend phase 1 at DBC but sometimes there is a small voice inside my head that says something like "Everybody else is going to outperform you." or "This is crazy, you aren't ready yet!". I am working on eliminating this issue but I don't think it will hold me back too much.</p>
