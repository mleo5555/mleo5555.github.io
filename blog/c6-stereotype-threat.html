        <h2>Pairing and Giving Feedback</h2>
        <h4>8/9/15</h4>
        <h3>Pairing</h3>
          <p>Most of my pairing sessions have been enjoyable and a great learning experience. I feel the most comfortable with my pair when we are on a similar skill level and neither of us feels like the other is ahead or behind. I've only had two pairing sessions where I felt like I wasn't bringing much to the table because I was struggling with concepts that my pair had a clear understanding of. Obviously this helped me highlight some of my weaknesses but in the moment it isn't a very pleasant experience. I enjoy pairing sessions because they tend to be efficient and gives me the necesarry experience of working with others on the same coding project. It is always rewarding when collaborative work leads to a successful solution. Something I love about pairing is the fact that each pair brings a unique set of knowledge to each challenge. Both pairs may have two completely different solutions that work; this is always fun to examine each other's approach and determine what makes the most sense.</p>
        <h3>Feedback</h3>
          <p>Reading feedback from others I've paired with has been super helpful. It has helped me realize some weaknesses I need to focus on. For example, when I am struggling to understand something I tend to get quite and think instead of asking questions or saying "Hold on, can you explain x, y, and z before we continue?" I've been improving in this area by being more vocal about my clarity on the challenge at hand. Some additional feedback informed me that my syntax knowledge could use some improvement. I completely agree with this feedback and I am working harder towards not relying on looking up syntax on google and trying my best to recall syntax from memory, as well as re-reading parts of The Well Grounded Rubyist. I don't mind writing feedback for those I've paired with. Sometimes I find it hard to think of something constructive to say because the session went so smoothly. Aside from this, writing feedback is never a problem for me.</p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>I think using pairing and feedback to guide our learning is incredibly helpful. The pairing sessions and feedback exspose my ignorance to make me stronger in the future. I look forward every pairing session because it leads to improvement.</p>
