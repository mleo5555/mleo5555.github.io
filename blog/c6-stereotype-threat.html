        <h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>
        <h4>8/16/15</h4>
          <p>Stereotype threat is the potential in confirming stereotypical characteristics about ones self. I've always known about this concept but never thought too deeply about it. One example from my life is the idea that men should be extroverted, decisive, and strive to lead. I am naturally introverted and enjoy being alone from time to time. When I was younger, I felt like a loser if I didn't enjoy participating in certain social activities that my peers did. Even though I was very introverted, I still had plenty of friends that enjoyed my company. When my friends began going to parties and consuming alcohol it made me nervous. I wasn't leading or being as socially active as I was expected to be. I was always unsure of myself when making a decision and just let things come my way. Technically there was nothing wrong with me and I still enjoyed my life, but there was always a voice in the back of my head telling me to be more extroverted and do something about it. After I graduated from high school, I actively pursued changing my ways in order to become more of a leader.</p>
          <p>Today I am much more outgoing and decisive than I was in the past but I still enjoy my alone time. It is interesting the think that if certain male stereotypes didn't exist, my path may be completely different. I am very happy with my life and who I am today but it took me a while to understand that being introverted is not a bad thing. I realize this isn't a traditional example to stereotype threat but it the only thing I could think of relating to my life.</p>
