        <h2>Conflict Analysis</h2>
        <h4>8/29/15</h4>
        <p>A good friend of mine recently came over to my house to hang out. We were catching up and exchanging stories when I brought up an interesting topic of conversation. This topic was private and I verbally told my friend to keep it to himself - he understood. I trust my friend and I wasn't concererned about whether or not her could keep a secret. Several days later I discovered that my friend told other people about our conversation. As soon as I found out I contacted him and expressed how this made me feel. He felt terrible and knew he made a mistake. It took me several days to calm down and think strait but I forgave him since we are great friends.</p>
        <p>The source of this conflict was my friend choosing to break a promise. I trusted my friend would respect my wish and keep our conversation secret. This break in trust made me feel betrayed and disrespected. Talking about this issue with my friend helped him understand how his actions made me feel and this conflict will hopefully never happen again. If I ignored the issue, the same problem would likely arise in the future. If I could go back in time, I would approach this problem in the same way I chose to. If you don't tell somebody that their actions make you feel negative, their actions will never change.</p>
