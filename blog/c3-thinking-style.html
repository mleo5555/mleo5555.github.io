        <h2>What's My Thinking Style?</h2>
        <h5>7/26/15</h5>
          <p>Understanding your own thinking style can greatly improve how you learn new concepts. The <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Gregorc Thinking Style</a> is a great way to analyze your own thinking style and understand your strengths and weaknesses. If you aren't sure what your thinking style is, take the <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">personal thinking style</a> quiz and find out! I found it really fun and interesting to learn more about myself.</p>
          <h3>Concrete Random</h3>
          <p>My thinking style is concrete random. Someone with this thinking style enjoys experimenting with things in order to understand them and often times needs to work on something alone first to feel comfortable with the subject. The concrete random thinking style dislikes restrictions, limitations, and formal reports which I feel applies directly to me. Something I've always known about myself is that I need to interact with something and use trial and error to feel comfortable with it. While I do enjoy working with others, I've noticed that I have better focus when doing research independently. </p>
          <p>Understanding my thinking style will assist me throughout DBC. I will be able to be vocal about my strengths and weaknesses upfront so anybody I pair with will understand what to expect from me. I can focus on interacting with new subjects and using trial and error instead of simply reading or watching tutorials. I've already absorbed a great deal of knowledge from developing my website and I will continue to learn by being creative and trying new techniques.</p>
          <h3>Thoughts on Phase 0</h3>
          <p>I am about to finish unit 1 of phase phase 0 and I've already learn so much. I'll be honest, I was incredibly nervous the first week because of the heavy work load but I was able to quickly adapt. My biggest struggle so far was CSS positioning - I still have a lot of improvement to do. This struggle relates directly to my thinking style. In order for me to grasp a new concept I need to take a hands on approach and use trial and error - I believe this is why CSS positioning was a challenge for me. I need to use the chrome toolkit and mess around with different CSS syntax until my mind can see what moved and understand why it moved. I believe I need to set an hour aside every other day to CSS positioning until I am confident in my abilities.</p>
          <h3>Growth Mindset vs. Fixed Mindset</h3>
          <p>Someone with a growth mindset views challenges as a chance to grow and learn something new. Someone with a fixed mindset views challenges as a roadblock and avoids them completely. I believe I have a growth mindset because I enjoy being challenged. Since phase 0 has begun, I've been trying out different learning and studying techniques to see what works best for me based on my thinking style. If I am struggling to understand a new concept I've found success in taking a 20 minute break to clear my mind and refresh my focus. I've also found success in time boxing because it is easy for me to spend WAY to much time on a challenge. I am still working on developing optimal study habits but I believe I am on my way.</p>
