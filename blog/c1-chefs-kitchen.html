      Shereef's analogy of the kitchen vs. table mindset was thought provoking. I embrace the kitchen mindset of working with others and sharing ideas in order to reach a common goal. I understand that every student comes into the program with different backgrounds and varying levels of programming knowledge - this makes the experience more exciting! Every student will bring something unique to DBC and offer a valuable perspective. I imagine the culture at DBC to be diverse and open minded. I pride myself in being open to new ideas and doing things outside of my comfort zone, so I am predicting I will be a great fit. So far my expectations of DBC have remained about the same - I believe I had a good idea of what I was getting myself into.

      I am finishing week 1 of phase 0 and I am a mixture of excited and nervous. I am nervous because I know there is so much work ahead and there is a lot on the line, but I am excited because I've already learned so much and I can't wait to devour more knowledge. It is comforting to know that my cohort is doing the program alongside me and there for support. I can't wait to start paired programming because it'll give me a better understanding of me strengths and weaknesses. There so much to look forward to.
