      Git is software that allows programmers to save seperate versions of a project without deleting any previous versions, aka version control. Tracking and adding changes with git makes it easier for developers to understand what has been changed in a program while being able to safely revert to a previous version of a project. This is extremly useful if you consider a scenario where a new version is saved that contains faulty code.
          </p>

      Git tracks changes locally on your computer with version control. Creating and saving changes with git typically looks like this: Edit any file(s) of your choice, 'Add' or 'Stage' the file(s) which prepares specific files to be saved, then you complete the process by committing which takes the file(s) and adds a permenant snapshot to your git directory. Making changes safely typically involves utilizing branches in git. The master branch is the main version of code that has been tested and works properly. It is best practice to create a seperate branch when implimenting change to your code. A seperate branch enables a programmer to clone the master branch and test new code without worrying about negatively affecting the master.

      Github functions the same way as git, however Github exists remotely on the internet. Github is useful for teams of programmers because they can work on separate problems on the same project and collaborate once their tasks are accomplished.
