        <h2>Meet Matt</h2>
        <p>I'm from a small suburb of Chicago called Riverside. I am 24 years old and have a B.S. in Nutrition and Wellness with a minor in Marketing from Bradley University at Peoria, IL. It should be no surprise that I love cooking, nutrition, and working out. I love traveling to new places and experiencing different cultures. The picture of me to the right is in Amsterdam - one of my all time favorite cities! If I ever watch TV, which isn't very often, 99% of the time I will be watching The Food Network and Travel Channel. Andrew Vimmern, the host of my favorite show on Travel Channel - <i>Bizzarre Foods</i>, says:<p><i>"I believe that sharing food is the best way to experience other cultures, so I travel the world sampling one tasty morsel at a time."</i></p>
        <p>This quote embodies how I feel about food and travel. I had the pleasure of experiencing different parts of Italy, Spain, The Netherlands, France, and Germany two years ago. My most recent trip was to Seattle where I spent a week with my brother. I plan to keep visiting new places and experience as many new things as possible.</p>
